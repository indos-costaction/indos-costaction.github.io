title: Coordination
---

In 2024 a group of researchers gathered to write a proposal for a COST Action, which was subsequently awarded in 2025 and which officially started in November 2025. Our network brings together leading researchers and practitioners from across Europe and beyond. The [Memorandum of Understanding](https://e-services.cost.eu/files/domain_files/CA/Action_CA24161/mou/CA24161-e.pdf) (MoU) details the plans as set out at the start of the action. During the course of the action these plans will be implemented and updated.  

Below you can find information about the core team coordinating our COST Action.
