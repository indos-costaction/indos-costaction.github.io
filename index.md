title: INDoS - Improving Neuroimaging Data for Sharing
---

Improving Neuroimaging Data for Sharing (INDoS) is a European [COST Action](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA24161) focused on transforming how human neuroimaging data — such as MRI, MEG, and EEG — is shared and reused. By addressing key challenges in data quality control, metadata standardization, preprocessing pipelines, and ethical and legal frameworks, INDoS fosters cross-disciplinary collaboration, develops FAIR-aligned guidelines and tools, and trains researchers in open science practices to accelerate innovation and reproducibility in brain research.

Our mission is to make neuroimaging data truly [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) — Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable — by developing shared standards, tools, and ethical guidelines for data sharing. INDoS connects experts across Europe to improve data quality, transparency, and legal clarity, enabling researchers to share and reuse neuroimaging data efficiently, responsibly, and reproducibly.

## Key Objectives

- **Establish shared standards for data quality** Develop and promote guidelines for quality assessment and control (QA/QC) across neuroimaging modalities to ensure transparent, reliable, and reusable data.
- **Enhance metadata practices** Improve the description and annotation of neuroimaging data and experimental information to make datasets more findable, interoperable, and reusable.
- **Standardize preprocessing pipelines** Define and disseminate rational, well-documented preprocessing procedures to improve reproducibility and facilitate data integration across studies and sites.
- **Clarify ethical and legal frameworks** Develop practical guidelines and training to help researchers navigate privacy regulations and ethical considerations while sharing human neuroimaging data responsibly.
- **Build a pan-European network** Connect researchers, software developers, data stewards, and legal experts to foster collaboration, knowledge exchange, and the development of interoperable tools.
- **Promote training and capacity building** Create high-quality training materials, workshops, and opportunities for young researchers to strengthen skills in open science and neuroimaging data sharing.
- **Support dissemination and adoption** Ensure that the Action’s outputs—guidelines, tools, and standards—are widely communicated, openly accessible, and adopted by the neuroimaging community and beyond.
- **Advance FAIR and open science** Contribute to a shift toward more transparent, efficient, and ethical research practices in neuroimaging, aligning with European and international open science goals.

## About COST Action

[COST](https://www.cost.eu/) (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) is a funding agency for research and innovation networks. COST Actions help connect research initiatives across Europe and enable scientists to grow their ideas by sharing them with their peers. This boosts their research, career and innovation.
