An Inclusiveness Target Country (ITC) conference grant supports a presentation of own work given by a researcher/innovator affiliated in an Inclusiveness Target Country / Near Neighbour Country. The purpose is foster grantees’ participation in high-level conferences fully organized by a third party, i.e. not organized or co-organized by the COST Action. An ITC Conference Grantee receives support for attending and presenting their work (poster/oral presentation) at a conference. This:

- Serves COST Excellence and Inclusiveness Policy.
- Supports researchers and innovators affiliated in a legal entity in an Inclusiveness Target Countries (ITC)/Near Neighbour Countries (NNC) to establish a strong network and increase their visibility in the research community through sharing their work and to gain knowledge.
- Contributes to increasing visibility of the Action.

The list of COST ITCs is available at <https://www.cost.eu/about/strategy/excellence-and-inclusiveness/>, and the list of COST NNCs is available at <https://www.cost.eu/about/strategy/cost-global-networking/>.

## Financial support

ITC grants are a contribution for travelling, accommodation and subsistence expenses, registration fee, printing of scientific poster and overall effort. No invoices are required. The maximum grant amount is 2,000 EUR for face-to-face conferences (), and 500 EUR for online conferences.

## The grant awarding process

The supported activity, including reporting and payment, must be carried out entirely within one Grant Period. Each Grant Period runs from the 1 November until the 31 October of the following year.

Each application is reviewed by two (or three in case the outcome is not consistent) MC or WG members who are guided by the Grant Awarding Coordinator. The Grant Awarding Coordinator advises the Action Chair who acts on the advice if the budget allows. Successful grantees receive a grant letter.

The supported activity ends when the payment is recorded. Therefore, applicants should allow time for submitting the report, evaluating it, and processing the payment within the Grant Period. This means that the work of conference participations funded in this call should be complete by 30 September to give adequate time for reporting and grant payment by 31 October.
